# Temporal analysis of a dry grassland 

In this repository we offer the materials for a detailed study of the dry grassland found on Devin Hill,
Czech Republic, where we have phenological data (sampling taking plance every 2-months). In particular, we explore:

1. Whether species' interactions change with time and are structured by functional traits.
2. Whether the dynamic behavior of the species populations (i.e. chaotic vs predictable) is structured by the functional traits.
3. What is the relative role of functional traits and climatic variables in explaining the community-level synchronic features.
