    abstract = {
    Nonlinear Time Series Analysis with R provides a practical guide to emerging
    empirical techniques allowing practitioners to diagnose whether highly
    fluctuating and random appearing data are most likely driven by random or
    deterministic dynamic forces. It joins the chorus of voices recommending
    'getting to know your data' as an essential preliminary evidentiary step in
    modelling. Time series are often highly fluctuating with a random appearance.
    Observed volatility is commonly attributed to exogenous random shocks to
    stable real-world systems. However, breakthroughs in nonlinear dynamics raise
    another possibility: highly complex dynamics can emerge endogenously from
    astoundingly parsimonious deterministic nonlinear models. Nonlinear Time
    Series Analysis (NLTS) is a collection of empirical tools designed to aid
    practitioners detect whether stochastic or deterministic dynamics most likely
    drive observed complexity. Practitioners become 'data detectives'
    accumulating hard empirical evidence supporting their modelling approach.
    This book is targeted to professionals and graduate students in engineering
    and the biophysical and social sciences. Its major objectives are to help
    non-mathematicians -- with limited knowledge of nonlinear dynamics -- to
    become operational in NLTS; and in this way to pave the way for NLTS to be
    adopted in the conventional empirical toolbox and core coursework of the
    targeted disciplines. Consistent with modern trends in university
    instruction, the book makes readers active learners with hands-on computer
    experiments in R code directing them through NLTS methods and helping them
    understand the underlying logic (please see www.marco.bittelli.com). The
    computer code is explained in detail so that readers can adjust it for use in
    their own work. The book also provides readers with an explicit framework --
    condensed from sound empirical practices recommended in the literature --
    that details a step-by-step procedure for applying NLTS in real-world data
    diagnostics.

    number = {12},
    volume = {13},
    journal = {Ecosphere},
    abstract = {{Ecological stability refers to a range of concepts used to quantify how
    species and environments change over time and in response to disturbances.
    Most empirically tractable ecological stability metrics assume that systems
    have simple dynamics and static equilibria. However, ecological systems are
    typically complex and often lack static equilibria (e.g., predator–prey
    oscillations, transient dynamics, chaos). Failing to account for these
    factors can lead to biased estimates of stability, in particular, by
    conflating effects of observation error, process noise, and underlying
    deterministic dynamics. To distinguish among these processes, we combine
    three existing approaches: state space models; delay embedding methods; and
    particle filtering. Jointly, these provide something akin to a
    deterministically “detrended” version of the coefficient of variation,
    separately tracking variability due to deterministic dynamics versus
    stochastic perturbations. Moreover, these variability estimates can be used
    to forecast dynamics, classify underlying sources of stochastic dynamics, and
    estimate the “exit time” before a state change takes place (e.g., local
    extinction events). Importantly, the time‐delay embedding methods that we
    employ make very few assumptions about the functions governing deterministic
    dynamics, which facilitates applications in systems with limited data and a
    priori biological knowledge. To demonstrate how complex dynamics without
    static equilibria can bias ecological stability estimates, we analyze
    simulated time series of abundance dynamics in a system with time‐varying
    carrying capacity and empirically observed abundance dynamics of the green
    algae Chlamydomonas terricola grown in a diverse microcosm mixture under
    variable temperature conditions. We show that stability estimates based on
    raw observations greatly overestimate temporal variability and fail to
    accurately forecast time to extinction. In contrast, joint application of
    state space modeling, delay embedding, and particle filters were able to: (1)
    correctly quantify the contributions of deterministic versus stochastic
    variability; (2) successfully estimate “true” abundance dynamics; and (3)
    correctly forecast time to extinction. Our results therefore demonstrate the
    importance of accounting for effects of complex, nonstatic dynamics in
    studies of ecological stability and provide an empirically tractable and
    flexible toolkit for conducting these measurements.}
